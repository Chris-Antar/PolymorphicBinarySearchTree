# PolymorphicBinarySearchTree

Description:
- This project utilizes Java to design an algorithm with the ability to navigate through any maze using Breadth-First Search and Depth-First-Search.
- It Optimized navigation using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find shortest paths between nodes in the maze to lead to shorter run times of the program.

Utilization:
In the example below the Polymorphic BST is used to sort every word in a .txt file in alaphabetical order and store the word count. The "funGUI" is used to demonstrate.
